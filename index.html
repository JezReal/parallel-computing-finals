          Explain what pipelining is.
          <p>
            - In parallel computing, pipelining is a strategy in which an
            operation or computational task is broken down into different stages
            which are run by different processors. The inputs that are required
            in the tasks are being fed into it. It is also worth noting that
            these stages must be executed in a particular order for it to be
            completed successfully. For a better understanding, imagine a lot of
            packages/boxes running through a conveyor belt. These
            <i>"boxes"</i> or <i>"packages"</i> can be thought of as the tasks
            that are broken down. While these <i>"packages"</i> are running
            through the conveyor belt, more stuff are being added onto it such
            as the contents, or branding. We can think of the
            <i>"contents"</i> and <i>"branding</i> as the inputs that are being
            fed into these tasks.

          How does parallel programming/computing works? What do you think will
          be the advantage of utilizing parallel approach?
          <p>
            - Parallel programming/computing works by taking advantage of the
            multiple processors to be able to process more tasks at once.
            Instead of using only one processor in running tasks, it also uses
            other available processors to be able to execute instructions
            parallel to each other.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 10px">
            There are a number of advantages in using a parallel approach one of
            them being the amount of time that is saved. Because parallel
            computing takes advantage of multiple processors in executing tasks,
            it is therefore able to save time because instead of waiting for the
            other tasks to complete before proceeding to the next, it is already
            running therefore saving time.
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 10px">
            Another advantage of using parallel computing is the ability to
            solve larger and more complex problems. In fact, one of the primary
            purposes of parallel computing is to solve computationally expensive
            tasks. Because there are multiple processors that are working on
            finding the solution, they can work together and solve the problem
            faster and consequently, be able to solve more complex problems as
            well.

          In a right triangle, the square of the length of one side is equal to
          the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Write a
          program that prompts the user to enter the length of the three sides
          of a triangle and then outputs a message indicating whether the
          triangle is a right triangle.

        <li>
          Write a program that prompts the user to input a number between 0 and
          35. If the number is less than or equal to 9, the program should
          output the number, otherwise, it should output A for 10, B for 11, C
          for 12... and Z for 35.

          Write a program that will display all numbers divisible by 3, 4 and 5

          Differentiate between Multiprocessing and Multithreading. Explain.
          <p>
            - Multiprocessing refers to a system that has more than one
            processor. These processors can then have multiple threads.
            Multithreading on the other hand, refers to the ability of a
            processor to execute multiple threads. A main difference to note
            between the two is that in multithreading, all the threads that
            belong in the same process share their memory and resources.
            Meanwhile, in multiprocessing, each process is being allocated their
            own memory and resources.

          Explain the difference between Serial Computing and Parallel
          Computing.
          <p>
            - Serial computing, from the name itself, is a type of computing
            wherein tasks are being executed in series or in a line. Parallel
            computing however, is a type of computing in which tasks are being
            executed parallel to each other or in simpler terms, they are being
            executed at the same time. A good way of looking at it is take for
            an example a queue for a cash register. In serial computing, there
            is only one cash register and a lot of people are lining up for this
            one cash register. This is serial computing. The people in line are
            the tasks that has to be processed and the cash register is the
            processor. In serial processing, each task has to wait for their
            turn.In parallel computing, on the other hand, has multiple cash
            registers. Because there are multiple cash registers, people can
            line up for other cash registers with fewer people in line so they
            can finish faster. This is parallel computing. Multiple tasks (or
            people in the illustration) can be processed at the same time making
            the overall process much faster.

          Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first
          will be a list of numbers. The second parameter will be a string that
          can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none. If the second
          parameter is "asc", then the function should return a list with the
          numbers in ascending order. If it's "desc", then the list should be in
          descending order, and if it's "none", it should return the original
          list unaltered.

        <li>
          Write a program that will generate 100 3-digit random numbers and
          store it in a list. The program should display the following:
        </li>
        <ul type="a">
          <li>All elements in the list</li>
          <li>All numbers grouped by odd and even numbers</li>
          <li>All numbers divisible by 9</li>
          <li>All prime numbes</li>
          <li>All numbers that contains the digit 9 (e.g. 29, 91, 393, 961)</li>
