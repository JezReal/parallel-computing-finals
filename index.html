    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Level 1:</h3>
      <ol start="4">
        <li>Explain what pipelining is.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Level 2:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How does parallel programming/computing works? What do you think will
          be the advantage of utilizing parallel approach?
        </li>
        <li>
          In a right triangle, the square of the length of one side is equal to
          the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Write a
          program that prompts the user to enter the length of the three sides
          of a triangle and then outputs a message indicating whether the
          triangle is a right triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a program that prompts the user to input a number between 0 and
          35. If the number is less than or equal to 9, the program should
          output the number, otherwise, it should output A for 10, B for 11, C
          for 12... and Z for 35.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a program that will display all numbers divisible by 3, 4 and 5
          from 1-50.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Level 3:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Differentiate between Multiprocessing and Multithreading. Explain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain the difference between Serial Computing and Parallel
          Computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first
          will be a list of numbers. The second parameter will be a string that
          can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none. If the second
          parameter is "asc", then the function should return a list with the
          numbers in ascending order. If it's "desc", then the list should be in
          descending order, and if it's "none", it should return the original
          list unaltered.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Level 4:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Write a program that will generate 100 3-digit random numbers and
          store it in a list. The program should display the following:
        </li>
        <ul type="a">
          <li>All elements in the list</li>
          <li>All numbers grouped by odd and even numbers</li>
          <li>All numbers divisible by 9</li>
          <li>All prime numbes</li>
          <li>All numbers that contains the digit 9 (e.g. 29, 91, 393, 961)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Given a linked list of size K, your task is to complete the function
          sum_of_lastN_nodes(), which should return the sum of last N nodes of
          the linked list. The function takes two arguments as input, the
          reference pointer of the head of the linked list and the integer N.
